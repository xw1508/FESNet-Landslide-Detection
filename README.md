FESNet: A Collaborative Fusion Network of Edge Cues and Deep Semantic Representations for High-Precision Landslide Detection
Coming Soon: Code Release

This repository will host the official implementation of our paper:

"FESNet: A Collaborative Fusion Network of Edge Cues and Deep Semantic Representations for High-Precision Landslide Detection" (under review)
This article mainly refers to the YOLO architecture https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5, with datasets from 
《O. Ghorbanzadeh, Y. Xu, P. Ghamisi, M. Kopp, and D. Kreil, “Landslide4sense: Reference benchmark data and deep learning models for landslide detection,” IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and RemoteSensing, vol. 60, pp. 1–17, 2022》 and 《S. Ji, D. Yu, C. Shen, W. Li, and Q. Xu, “Landslide detection from an open satellite imagery and digital elevation model dataset using attention boosted convolutional neural networks,” Landslides, vol. 17, no. 6, pp. 1337–1352, 2020》

In addition, we have provided some original images for reference and a file shared through cloud storage: Mine Landslide UAV Dataset
