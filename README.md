# FESNet-Landslide-Detection
FESNet: A Collaborative Fusion Network of Edge Cues and Deep Semantic Representations for High-Precision Landslide Detection
Coming Soon: Code Release

This repository will host the official implementation of our paper:

"FESNet: A Collaborative Fusion Network of Edge Cues and Deep Semantic Representations for High-Precision Landslide Detection" (under review)

The code and related resources are not publicly available at the moment.
We will release the complete source code, pretrained models, and usage instructions once the paper is accepted.

Stay tuned! ðŸš€
